# Generative AI for TPRM Automation

## Overview
This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that leverages **LLaMA (llama-cpp-python)** to automate **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** tasks. It includes vendor onboarding, contract management, real-time monitoring, and advanced insights.

## Features
1. **Vendor Onboarding**  
   - Collects vendor details (industry, services, certifications).  
   - Generates AI-powered risk assessment questions.  

2. **Contract Management**  
   - Allows vendor selection.  
   - Generates AI-drafted contracts based on predefined templates.  

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Displays real-time alerts and news updates on vendor risks.  

4. **Advanced Insights**  
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies reasons behind vendor risks.  
   - **Predictive Risk Scenarios**: Forecasts future risks.  
   - **Financial Health Analysis**: Evaluates vendor stability.  

## Installation
